# Los Angeles County COVID-19 - Independent Data Project
This project aims to collect and visualize COVID-19 data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.
The unique data featured here, and not directly from the public health department, is time series data.
Time series data is provided for case counts by countywide statistical areas and demographic groups.
These features help explain the where and who of the pandemic's spread.
